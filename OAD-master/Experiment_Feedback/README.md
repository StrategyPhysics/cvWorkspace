## Experiment Feedback

### Key Facts

- **Adaptive Acquisition Engine** allows modifying **running experiments** using Python scripts
- Python Scripts can access the **current system status** and results from **Online Image Analysis** on runtime during the experiment
- **Data Logging** or starting an **External Application** (Python, Fiji, MATLAB, …), directly from within the imaging experiment is possible

### Important Features

Experiment Feedback is a very flexible concept and allow ofr example for the following workflows or applications

- Create dynamic acquisition-experiments
- Observe parameters during acquisition via online image analysis
- Monitor the status of the microscope and/or the sample
- Automatically react on changes of the sample or other parameters
- Modify the hardware/experiment parameters during the acquisition
- increase integration time when the sample bleaches
- stop the acquisition after a certain number of objects was detected
- Create custom log-files, integrate data logging in the ZEN experiment
- Start external applications (Python, Matlab,….)
- Display measurement results already during image acquisition
- Track objects online in XY

The general Experiment feedback workflow has three major parts, where the so-called **"Main Loop"** is the most important. Here it is possible to define the rules that allow the user to react on the results retrieved from the **Online Image Analysis** and adapt the running experiments, send the respective signal to external application or log the data.

Those Experiment Feedback scripts use similar to the other ZEN python scripts IronPython to control the workflows within the running acquisition.

## Experiment Feedback - Examples

The tutorial contains several ready-to-use examples for instructive and typical workflows that allow to get familiar with the possibilities of that tool.
