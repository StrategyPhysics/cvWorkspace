### Call4Help - Image Anaylsis and Automation

This session is all about the image analysis and automation challenges of the participants.
Every will have the opportunity to shortly present and discuss a challenge from his/her daily work.
The trainers and the other participants will try to give some initial ideas how to solve that challenge
using the solutions and tools used during the workshop.

By no means the ideas must be limited to ZEN releated tools. Any idea is welcome here.
