# ZEN-APEER Integration

## ZEN APEER (on-site)

Starting with ZEN blue 3.2 and ZEN core 3.0 it is possible to run your own code directly integrated in ZEN workflows. This is achieved by using APEER modules directly in ZEN. Such modules typically consist of

- your code (Python, Fiji, R, C#, C++, ...)
- dockerfile
- modul_specification.json

Inside ZEN the module specification is used to render the UI of an APEER module excatly as it would look like on the APEER cloud platform. For more information and details about the requirements please refer to to official documentation: **[APEER - ZEN Integration](https://docs.apeer.com/hybrid/zen-integration)**

## How does it work

The general scheme of this ZEN APEER integration is visualized below

## Scripting Integration

It is also possible to use the docker integration from within the ZEN scripting interface.
