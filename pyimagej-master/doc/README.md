## Real World Examples

Here are links to some examples and use cases:

* The [examples](examples) in this repository demonstrate some workflows.
* The [cellprofiler](cellprofiler) folder in this repository contains some
  sample [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) workflows demonstrating
  integration with ImageJ via PyImageJ.
* The [pyimagej-dextr](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej-dextr) repository
  uses Deep Extreme Cut (DEXTR) to generate ImageJ ROIs via PyImageJ.
* [PoreSpy](https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy), a collection of image analysis
  tools used to extract information from 3D images of porous materials,
  uses some ImageJ filters via PyImageJ.
